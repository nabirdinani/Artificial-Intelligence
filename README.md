#Artificial Intelligence 

**In a Nutshell**

The problem is to design a circuit to implement a given logic function, using a genetic algorithm (GA) and another search method of your choice (such as depth- first, A*, etc.), subject to certain constraints, and to display the progress of the search graphically. Each circuit may contain only AND, OR, and NOT gates. There can be any number of AND and OR gates, but no more than two NOT gates. The AND and OR gates may have any number of inputs per gate.
